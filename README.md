## WinVim
This is an abandoned attempt at replicating at replicating "Vimium" browser extension for Windows 11. 
This is a pretty solid core, but i've abandonned it due to moving to linux and overall not caring about it all that much. 
Maybe someday I will try and rebase the project to another programming language for linux, so this might be helpfull. 
Rest in peace, my 50+ hours of work...
