TODO: 

* !!! Rework project structure! 
Make it so that AutomationElementsDict is universal for all automation elements, not just TaskbarElements. 
After that make ProcessHintKey a separate class with separate logic, that interracts only with AutomationElements dict, that is allready universal.
Do the same thing in an OverlayWindow.

Also, add logic to show key pressed on screen. Maybe only for overlay, maybe in some other way.
The goal is to separate Automation Dictionary from logic filling it, separate OverlayWindow from unique automationelements classes, to use only universal autoamtiondict. 
Separate Modes logic from Processing hint keys logic, because it will be troublesome to  rework it in the future.
